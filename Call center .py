# Assignment: Call Center
# You're creating a program for a call center. Every time a call comes in you need a way to track that call. One of your program's requirements is to store calls in a queue while callers wait to speak with a call center employee.

# You will create two classes. One class should be Call, the other CallCenter.

# Call Class
# • Create your call class with an init method. Each instance of Call() should have:
# Attributes:

# • unique id

# • caller name

# • caller phone number

# • time of call

# • reason for call
# Methods:

# • display: that prints all Call attributes.
# CallCenter Class
# • Create your call center class with an init method. Each instance of CallCenter() should have the following attributes:
# Attributes:

# • calls: should be a list of call objects

# • queue size: should be the length of the call list
# Methods:

# • add: adds a new call to the end of the call list

# • remove: removes the call from the beginning of the list (index 0).

# • info: prints the name and phone number for each call in the queue as well as the length of the queue.
# You should be able to test your code to prove that it works. Remember to build one piece at a time and test as you go for easier debugging!

# Ninja Level: add a method to call center class that can find and remove a call from the queue according to the phone number of the caller.

# Hacker Level: If everything is working properly, your queue should be sorted by time, but what if your calls get out of order? Add a method to the call center class that sorts the calls in the queue according to time of call in ascending order.

        self.reason = reason
        self.time = datetime.now()
